title: About Computing Fundamentals
layout: topic

---

This website is adapted from the website CompSci superbasics in response to the need for students across UO to learn how to use their computers on a
system level. Not everyone comes to college familiar with files, folders and keyboard shortcuts. That's OK: they didn't need to. Until now.

So here's somewhere we can give a student a link to if they are unfamiliar with some of the basics that some courses take as a baseline.

CompSci superbasics was originally built for the Foundation Programming
(python) course run by the
[department of Computer Science](http://cs.rhul.ac.uk/)
at
[Royal Holloway, University of London](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk).
It went live January 2021.

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website
(designed to run nicely on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com)) â€”
the whole repo is available under the MIT license.

It's currently a work in progress and maintained as a
[Beholder](https://www.beholder.uk/) project.
More topics coming as time allows.
